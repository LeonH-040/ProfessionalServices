Task project of the Front-End-Developer course on Coursera. Nr.2 of 4. 
Responsive design not included.

Task: 
Task: For the graded assessment, you need to develop a home page for one of four fictional clients. As you read through the client personas included in this reading, think about what the ideal home page for each of these clients would look like.

How can you use what you’ve learned over the course? For instance, how will you structure the provided information with semantic HTML tags? You can even start to think about what media elements you could include.

And how can you create a unique user experience with CSS? Will a grid or basic flexbox serve the client best? What CSS selectors will you use to not only style your page but also create interactivity? And don’t forget about effects! It’s time to have fun and think about how you can apply what you learned about CSS animations.

Fictional Persona:

Based in Madison, Wisconsin, Hair Day is a boutique hair salon that specializes in cut, color and styling. Hair Day also offers makeup and nail services, prides itself on its warm and relaxing atmosphere and is best known for edgy hair colors and on-trend cuts. The salon can only accommodate a small number of coloring appointments each week, so clients need to book far in advance. To keep clients inspired between appointments, the employees share makeup and nail tutorials on the Hair Day website. 

Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started specializing in edgy, custom coloring techniques. She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for her clients. Pria opened the salon with her good friend and talented hairdresser, Garry. They have a staff of seven: two stylists, three colorists, one manicurist and one make-up artist.
