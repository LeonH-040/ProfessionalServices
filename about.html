                        Hair Day began with a question that wouldn’t let go: Why should self-care feel rushed, impersonal—or worse—uninspired?

                        For Pria, hair was never just about maintenance. After earning her certificate as a professional colorist, she dove headfirst into the world of edgy, custom coloring techniques. She loved pushing creative boundaries—but found herself constantly frustrated by the salons she worked in. Clients were squeezed into overbooked schedules. Creativity was limited to the “safe” looks. And worst of all, no one seemed to be listening.

                        People came in asking for something bold, something personal—and left with something basic.

                        So Pria decided to create something different.
                        A space where every appointment feels like a little ritual. Where guests are heard, seen, and given the time and attention to truly express themselves. A place that doesn’t just follow trends—but helps set them.

                        Together with her good friend and talented hairdresser Garry, she opened Hair Day. What started as a dream shared between two friends is now a small but mighty team of seven: two stylists, three colorists, one manicurist, and one makeup artist—each one passionate about helping people feel their most vibrant, confident selves.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Here, color is more than a service—it’s self-expression. Makeup is more than beauty—it’s empowerment. And nails? Just another canvas for creativity.

                        We work by appointment only, because we believe in giving every guest the time they deserve. And when you walk out of Hair Day, we want you to feel like more than just “done”—we want you to feel you.

                        This is your moment. This is your Hair Day.
